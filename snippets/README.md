# Snippets of PHP #

### About ###

I think it is fairly self-explanatory, but if not - this is just a bunch of random pieces of PHP
code that I have either created (and perhaps abandoned!), or found elsewhere. Use them for whatever
you want, but there ain't any guarantees that they work, or will work for your app. Good luck!
