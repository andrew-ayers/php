# FizzBuzz - Why? Because...well...hmm

Yeah - here's a couple of fizzbuzz examples - one done "straight", the other
implemented as class. Basically, I had to do one of these as a part of a test
for an employer (I guess having close to 25 years of software development
experience means nothing nowadays), and after the test, I got a little carried
away playing with it. 

It's kinda strange how something simple like this can be fun to play around 
with. I was trying to see if I could make it faster. I didn't try every single
iteration (I have my limits as to how long something like this can hold my
attention) - but what I have here of three different versions gives an idea.
From what I can tell, all perform similarly, which leads me to believe (I have
no data to back this up) that PHP is optimizing all of them in a very similar
manner, leading to the consistency of the results.

Ah, well - anyhow, enjoy this, play with it, learn from it, laugh at it. And
good luck on your next interview process, too.

## Bugs? Suggestions?

Sure - send 'em my way, or do a pull request, or whatever. Hey, maybe we could
make the bestest and fastest and greatest-ever-ohboy! fizzbuzz example on the 
planet. And world peace! And something to beat Google. Sure. Why not?
